# PRVE
Derived from the work of RSSVE, RVE64k, RVE, EVO (Most of it), AVP, and KSRSS.

PRVE (Photo Realistic Visual Enhancement) is a visual enhancement mod for KSP RO/RSS. The mod combines old textures and configs with new scatter and Environmental Visual Enhancements configs to rebirth and make them better. Look at licensing for respected licensing on each texture.

NOTICE: Make sure older versions of PRVE and any other RSS visual mods are delete prior to installation.

### System Requirments

PRVE has been created with a rig of these properties:

- AMD Ryzen 5 1600
- 32gb RAM
- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6gb Dual fans

### Q/A

- **My clouds dont have any atmosphere effect on them.** - Hit Ctrl+F10 and press "Map EVE Clouds"
- **There are green clouds in Earth's atmosphere.** - Most likely because you have another visual mod installed, delete it.
- **There is a bug I have that isn't on this wall.** - Create a issue report under the tab named "Issues" and someone else or I will help you out.

## .zip file information

- **PRVE.zip** - The mod itself. I will eventally separate the textures inside of it for a lower and standard quality version (Gives support for lower-end rigs).
- **PRVE-64k.zip** - An addition to the PRVE.zip that adds 64k ground textures to earth.
- **PRVE-Addons.zip** - Extra components of the mod. Currently includes: **Exaggerated Earth bump map, Scatterer v0.08+ support**.
